Generating a 50 node 3D graph with 20% density.

Next steps:
1. Create an alternate mode that doesn't actually create the gameobjects. This way we should be able to generate graphs of size 1000x1000 or better without issues.
2. Create other types of graphs: 3D lattice, complete, perhaps directed?!??!
3. Its already set up to do so, but I need to implement some constraints for the graph coloring problem (<1h of work)
4. Add BnB algorithm to determine satisfiable sets.
